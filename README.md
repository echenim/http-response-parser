## Public APIs

### http_parser/1

Parses a binary HTTP response into a structured tuple comprising status code, reason phrase, headers, and body.

### bench/0

Benchmarks the parsing function, assessing performance across numerous iterations to facilitate optimization.

### test/0

Executes predefined tests to validate the parser's accuracy and robustness in handling different HTTP responses.

## Type Specifications

- `status()`: A positive integer that represents the HTTP status code.
- `reason()`: An atom that denotes the reason phrase of the response, e.g., `ok` or `no_content`.
- `headers()`: A list of tuples, each containing a binary key and a binary value, representing HTTP headers.
- `body()`: A binary string that embodies the HTTP response body.
- `http_response()`: A tuple that encapsulates a parsed HTTP response or an error indication.

## Detailed Function Descriptions

### http_parser/1

**Purpose:** This function ingests a binary HTTP response and parses it into a well-structured Erlang term, leveraging Erlang's pattern matching and binary processing features for efficient component extraction.

**Workflow:**

1. Divides the binary into headers and body.
2. Isolates the status code and reason phrase from the status line.
3. Processes headers into key-value pairs.
4. Compiles a tuple containing the status code, reason phrase, headers, and body.
5. Returns an error tuple with a descriptive message in case of any parsing failure.

### bench/0

**Objective:** To measure and average the execution time of the `http_parser` function, aiding in performance optimization.

**Implementation:** Repeatedly parses a sample response, computing the average execution time over all iterations.

### test/0

**Goal:** To ensure the parser's output accuracy and reliability across various HTTP response scenarios.

**Method:** Utilizes predefined responses and expected results to verify that the parser's output matches the anticipated outcomes.

## Internal Helper Functions

### split_status_and_body/1

**Functionality:** Separates the headers and body of an HTTP response according to the protocol's specified delimiters.

**Method:** Applies binary splitting techniques to segment the response, signaling an error for any malformed input.

### parse_status_line/1

**Objective:** To extract the HTTP version, status code, and reason phrase from the status line of the response.

**Approach:** Validates and segments the status line, ensuring conformity to format and data integrity, and returns error tuples for any irregularities.

### parse_headers/1

**Purpose:** To transform the header section of an HTTP response into a standardized list of key-value pairs.

**Execution:** Splits the header lines and further each line into key and value pairs, filtering and converting valid headers into a structured list.

## Conclusion

The `http_response_parser` module offers an eloquently designed solution for parsing HTTP responses in Erlang, showcasing a sophisticated API and internal logic. It simplifies the management and interpretation of binary HTTP responses, highlighting the module's efficacy and performance in processing HTTP communications.
